# The-Presuppositions
A long essay on 2 perspectives: the objective and the subjective.

This is an open (mostly) philosophical work. 

I'm interested in theoretical work, but I'm really new to philosophy, so if anyone with criticism & critiques -- positive, negative, whatever have you -- feels like commenting or adding commits pertaining to issues in this post, know it is much appreciated.

Thank you for your interest in this free and open source paper. I hope you enjoy.
